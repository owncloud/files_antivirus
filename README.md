# ownCloud Antivirus App   

files_antivirus is an antivirus app for [ownCloud](https://github.com/owncloud) based on [ClamAV](http://www.clamav.net).

Trigger CI (4)

## Details

The idea is to check for virus at upload-time, notifying the user (on screen and/or email) and
remove the file if it's infected.

## Status

The App is not complete yet, the following works/is done:
* It can be configured to work with the executable or the daemon mode of ClamAV
* If used in daemon mode it can connect through network- or local file-socket
* In daemon mode, it sends files to a remote/local server using INSTREAM command
* When the user uploads a file, it's checked
* If an uploaded file is infected, it's deleted and a notification is shown to the user on screen and an email is sent with details.
* Tested in Linux only
* Background Job to scan all files
* Test uploading from clients
* File size limit

## ToDo

* Configurations Tuneups
* Other OS Testing
* Look for ideas :P

## Requirements

* ClamAV (Binaries or a server running ClamAV in daemon mode)


## Install

* Install and enable the App
* Go to Admin Panel and [configure](https://doc.owncloud.org/server/10.0/admin_manual/configuration/server/antivirus_configuration.html) the App

## Enterprise Feature: ICAP Antivirus integration

The Files Antivirus app can support the [ICAP](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc3507) protocol if you are using the ownCloud Enterprise Edition.

Using the ICAP mode requires a valid enterprise license. If no license key is present, it will trigger the grace period to obtain a valid key.
After the expiration of the grace period / license key, the files_antivirus app will be disabled.

### Run with c-icap/clamav

c-icap has a built-in clamav module see https://sourceforge.net/p/c-icap/wiki/ModulesConfiguration/

An out-of-the-box docker image  _for testing purpose_ is available at https://hub.docker.com/r/deepdiver/icap-clamav-service

For simple local testing run docker run -ti deepdiver/icap-clamav-service and get it's ip using docker inspect.
The IP address needs to be setup in the configuration - see above

The request service for clamav has to be set to 'avscan' and the response header to 'X-Infection-Found'


### Run with Kaspersky

Kaspersky provides docker images as well (https://box.kaspersky.com/d/c8d8577dc2494256b45e/)
Follow the instructions in Kaspersky ScanEngine for Kubernetes.7z

Additional configuration: 
Enable Allow204 - this is necessary to tell kav to not send back the file contents.
see https://support.kaspersky.com/ScanEngine/1.0/en-US/201151.htm

The request service for clamav has to be set to 'req' and the response header to 'X-Virus-ID'


NOTE: The older versions of KAV did not send back the virus/infection name in an icap header.

In v2.0.0 the header to transport the virus can be configured. Default: No header is sent.
